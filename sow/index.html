                I chose <em>PurposeTalent</em> because of its
                <strong>playful design and clear message</strong>. Its design
                makes it more dynamic than a typical HR website. The clean look
                and playful vibe make it perfect for exemplifying how design and
                usability work together.

              <div class="card-title">2. Initial Impression</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                Right away, it feels <strong>polished and professional</strong>.
                The illustrations are really cohesive and work well together.
                But honestly, it feels <strong>a bit too perfect</strong>, like
                it's trying to be inspirational rather than down-to-earth, which
                might not connect with regular people or smaller companies.

              <div class="card-title">3. Structure</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                The site uses a simple <strong>scroll-down</strong> setup that
                walks you through their mission, what they do, testimonials, and
                contact info. It's easy to follow, but sometimes it's hard to
                tell whether they're talking to companies looking to hire or
                people looking out for jobs.

              <div class="card-content">
                The colors are <strong>pretty minimal</strong> with mostly
                whites, grays, and soft neutrals that contrast a bit with the
                vivid yellow, purple and red. This all gives it a calm,
                professional feel.
                <strong>Big bold fonts and lots of empty space</strong> make
                everything clear and easy to read. The photos of different
                professionals are nice, though it still looks pretty corporate.

              <div class="card-title">5. Interaction</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                The smooth scrolling animations and hover effects make it feel
                pretty smooth. These little details make the site feel more
                polished and guide you through the content. The only downside is
                that all these animations might slow things down on older phones
                or computers

              <div class="card-title">6. Usability</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                The site's pretty straightforward to navigate with clear buttons
                and a good layout. It loads fairly quickly and works well on
                different screen sizes. But the accessibility could be better
                because things like text contrast and keyboard navigation aren't
                great, which makes it harder for some people to use.

                <div class="card-content">
                  The site seems well-built but has a lot of images, which could
                  <strong>slow down loading times</strong>. It uses good HTML
                  structure. Getting rid of some heavy images and animation code
                  would help performance but it may decrease aesthetics.

                  PurposeTalent does a great job with visual design,
                  storytelling, and user experience. The minimal design mixed
                  with emotional content makes it feel
                  <strong>authentic</strong>. But some of the messaging is kind
                  of vague and sounds too idealistic without giving concrete
                  details.

          <strong>9. Conclusion</strong>
          <p>
            Overall, it's a really <strong>nicely designed site</strong> that
            combines good design, emotion, and function. The best parts are how
            it looks and the flow of the story. The weaknesses are that it's
            <strong>not always clear who they're talking to</strong>, and
            accessibility needs work.

                I chose <em>Stiff</em> because it's a creative/film studio
                portfolio that's all about
                <strong>personality, humor, and bold style</strong>. It's very
                interesting how they put character and storytelling at the
                center of their design.

              <div class="card-title">2. Initial Impression</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                It feels <strong>playful and edgy</strong> right away. The
                tagline "We make Laughs That Look Damn Good" shows confidence
                with humor. It's well-made but feels pretty niche, like they're
                talking to brands who want bold storytelling, not corporate at
                all.

                Standard portfolio sections: Work, News, About, Capabilities,
                Contact. The homepage starts with a bold hero, then shows
                portfolio projects with big images, followed by news, about
                section, and team bios. It's
                <strong>straightforward</strong> but you can jump to what
                interests you.

                >. Bold fonts for headlines with good hierarchy. The branding

                Accessibility questions: contrast in text over images, alt text,

                <strong>making it feel immersive</strong>. These effects build
                engagement but might be distracting if overdone.

                The main promise is clear with well-labeled sections. But jargon
                like "Ink ID" and "InkPay" might confuse non-tech users. The
                accessibility is good but it may have potential issues with text
                over images, contrast, and keyboard navigation. The heavy
                visuals and character art <strong>risk slow loading</strong>,
                especially on mobile.

          <p>
            It has an <strong>ambitious, modern branding</strong> with high
            production value. The clear sections for different offerings make
            accessibility better. However, the "play-to-earn" model assumes
            stable internet, good devices, and crypto knowledge,
            <strong>which excludes many people</strong>. Promises of money can
            be misleading if not clearly explained. The "Ink ID" thing raises
            privacy questions. The tone seems aimed at gamers and tech early
            adopters.

              <div class="card-content">
                I picked <em>WeAreExample</em> because it's a creative agency
                that really <strong>focuses on culture and branding</strong>.
                It's got strong visual work and storytelling, which makes it
                good for looking at how design and messaging work together.

              <div class="card-content">
                You immediately see "An Earned-Led Culture Agency," which feels
                bold and purpose-driven. Everything
                <strong
                  >looks premium and modern, definitely aimed at creativity and
                  quality</strong
                >. But it also feels exclusive, like it's made for big brands
                rather than everyday people or small businesses.

              <div class="card-title">3. Structure</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                The navigation is organized well: Home, About, What We Do, plus
                sections like "Who We Help" with subcategories. There's a strong
                portfolio section right up front showing their projects (hotels,
                restaurants, etc.). The flow from mission to work examples to
                contact makes sense. It's mainly
                <strong>focused on brands and experiences</strong> rather than
                individual people.

                The style is sleek with lots of high-quality images, probably
                dark backgrounds, and clean fonts. Feels like "luxury brand
                meets culture." Big headlines with broken-up copy create good
                rhythm. The images are aspirational—travel, hotels, design
                stuff. The branding is consistent throughout.

              <div class="card-title">5. Interaction</div>
              <div class="card-content">
                Navigation feels easy to use. Being able to filter their work by
                "Who We Help" is helpful. There's a newsletter signup and good
                social proof through portfolio images. Possible issues:
                <strong>heavy images might slow loading</strong>, text on images
                might be hard to read, and mobile/accessibility stuff is
                unclear.

                Probably optimized for visuals but risks slow loading with big
                images. The structure seems reasonable but needs a deeper check
                for accessibility features. Large hero images might hurt loading
                speeds or cause layout problems.

                  clients. Smaller or less glamorous brands might feel excluded.
                  Might emphasize polished lifestyles over everyday or diverse
